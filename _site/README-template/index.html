<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>Users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
<li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
<li>Toggle color theme to their preference</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshot</h3>
<p><img src="./screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select &quot;Take a Screenshot&quot;. You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a tool like <a href="https://getfireshot.com/">FireShot</a> to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.</p>
<p>Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.</strong></p>
